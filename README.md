# Message in a Bottle

## Description

Message in a Bottle is an innovative and engaging web application where users can submit and read messages that are stored using Firebase. When a user reads a message, it is deleted, ensuring that each message is a one-time experience, much like finding a message in a bottle.

## Features

Submit Messages: Users can submit their own messages which are then stored securely.

Read Messages: Users can read messages left by others. Each message is a unique encounter, as it is deleted after being read.

Firebase Integration: Leveraging Firebase for secure and efficient data storage.

## In-Progress

Race Conditions: Potential race conditions have not been addressed. Under the assumption of a small userbase, the current implementation provides the intended experience.

Character Limits: No limit on message size uploads.

Animation and proper UI Feedback.
